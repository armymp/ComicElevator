# Final Capstone

Worked With a team of 4 to develop a comic book collection web app using Agile methodology, Java, SQL, Spring MVC, JDBC, and Vue.js. App allows users to register, login, create comic book collections, add and remove comics to collections by calling Marvel API, make collections, private share collections with other users, and follow other users.
